  <h1> Homelessness in New York City After COVID-19 </h1>
</div>

  <div class="context">
    <p>  New York City has seen a rise in the homeless population since the 2008 recession.
      The Coalition For The Homeless reports numbers haven't been this high since the Great Depression in the 1930's.
      The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased this number, the Coalition reporting at least 48,000 homeless people in June of 2021 living in shelters.
      City officials state that New York is getting back on track with reopening but housing advocates say enough isn't being done. </p>
    </div>

  <h2> So what are some isssues the city needs to tackle? </h2>

  <div class="flex">
    <div class="icon">

      <div class="text"> According to the Coalition The primary cause of homelessness, particularly among families, is lack of affordable housing. Rent prices in NYC have increased across the 5 boroughs.Certain areas of high development have seen an increase of upwards of 70%. Most of these being luxury apartment buildings, while construction for affordable housing has stagnated.</div>
    </div>

  <div class="flex">
    <div class="icon">
      <img src="mental_health.png" alt=Mental_Health></div>
      <div class="text"> Homeless single adults have much higher rates of   mental illness, addiction disorders, and other severe health problems. Making it harder to secure full time work positions and connections.</div>
    </div>

  <div class="flex">
    <div class="icon">
      <img src="computer.png" alt=Internet_Access></div>
      <div class="text"> With many public services moving online internet access is more important than ever. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of many offices and schools. Internet access in shelters is crucial for homeless adults seeking public services, and homeless youth who still need to attend classes.</div>
    </div>

  <div class="flex">
    <div class="icon">
      <img src="repair.png" alt=repair></div>
      <div class="text"> A 2020 report from the City Comptroller's office on DHS' shelter repair squad found that repairs were consistently delayed. These delays lead to further relocations of residents of the shelters and would take years to get started. Burst pipes, communal bathroom upgrades and roof replacements. On top of forcing residents of the shelter to need to relocate these repairs these delays cost millions in taxpayer dollars.</div>
